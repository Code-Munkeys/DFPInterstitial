========== iOS DFP Interstitial Example ==========

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google AdMob Ads SDK. You must
add the SDK library and header files into your application. Be sure to also
include the DFP specific headers from the Add-ons/DoubleClick directory of the
download. The SDK files can be downloaded from
https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/.

This project comes with 2 types of interstitials:
  1. A splash screen interstitial.

    The splash screen interstitial is initialized in the app delegate and
    loaded using loadAndDisplayRequest:usingWindow:initialImage:. The initial
    image gets displayed at app startup until the interstitial is loaded, at
    which point the interstitial is automatically shown.

  2. A regular interstitial.

    In the main view controller, an intersitial is loaded when pushing the
    load button, and shown when pushing the show button once the interstitial
    has been loaded.

You can change the value of kSampleAdUnitID in SampleConstants.h to use your
own ad unit that serves interstitials.
